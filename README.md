## 📌 Purpose
The vision behind **Local Hub** is simple yet powerful, to give developers **full control** over their code, credentials, and repositories without the need for expensive storage subscriptions, "pro" features, or third-party restrictions.

At its core, Local Hub prioritizes **decentralization and security**, making it an ideal solution for **private repositories**. Instead of relying on centralized cloud services, your code stays **in your own system**, ensuring complete **ownership and privacy**.

Local Hub runs via an **Ngrok-exposed local server**, allowing you to securely share repositories with your team through a **one-time authentication process**. This approach ensures that access is **temporary and entirely in your hands**. If you detect any suspicious activity, you can instantly **shut down access**, protecting your data.

But Local Hub is more than just a hosting tool, it’s a **customizable framework**. It provides essential **repository management features** while allowing developers to **extend and adapt** it to their unique needs.

By keeping **security, flexibility, and decentralization** at its heart, Local Hub empowers developers to **take back control of their code without compromises**. If you believe in **open-source innovation** and **data privacy**, contribute in Local Hub and make this concept more powerful.

🧑‍💻 **Who Can Use Local Hub?** <br>
🔧 **How It Works?**<br>
🚀 **How to Use Local Hub?** <br>


## **Who can use Local Hub?** 
Local Hub is designed primarily for **developers and tech-savvy users** who want **full control** over their code and repositories. However, even users with **basic computer knowledge** and an understanding of how the internet works can follow simple steps to set it up and use it effectively.

## **How it works?** 
Local Hub follows a **lightweight yet powerful** architecture that runs within a **virtual environment** on your local system. This architecture is divided into two key components:

#### ⚙️ Backend  
- **Manages repositories, static files, and app views securely**  
- **Includes a caching mechanism** to optimize performance  

#### 🎨 Frontend  
- **Dynamic templates render and display folders/files from the backend**  
- **Utilizes dynamic routing** to provide seamless navigation without exposing unnecessary details  

The **backend and frontend** work together efficiently, ensuring a **smooth, secure, and real-time experience** for accessing and sharing repositories.

By keeping things **modular and extendable**, Local Hub allows developers to **customize and expand** its functionality based on their specific needs. Whether you're using it for **personal projects** or **team collaborations**, this framework provides **full ownership, security, and flexibility** all without relying on third-party platforms.



## **How to Use Local Hub?**  

### **Requirements**  
Before getting started, ensure your system meets the following **requirements**:  

1️⃣ **Python**: Version **3.12.4** (or any latest version). You can check your version using:  
   ```sh
   python --version
   ```  

2️⃣ **Ngrok**: Download and install Ngrok from [here](https://ngrok.com/downloads/windows). *(Local Hub also includes a preconfigured Ngrok binary in the repository try running it first before downloading.)*  

3️⃣ **Flask (Python Web Module)**: Install Flask using:  
   ```sh
   python -m pip install flask
   ```  

4️⃣ **Free Storage Space**: Ensure you have sufficient disk space based on your repository size. It’s recommended to **avoid using the C:\ drive** to prevent storage overflow and data loss.  

---

### **Step-by-Step Setup Guide**  

#### 🔹 **1. Choose a Storage Location**  
Select an **empty storage location** (e.g., `D:\LocalHub\`) for better security and performance.  

#### 🔹 **2. Clone the Repository**  
Download the Local Hub project by running:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ayahack89/localhub.git
```

#### 🔹 **3. Add Your Files**  
Place your **private repositories, files, and folders** in:  
```sh
local-hub\venv\Backend\Repositories\
```  

#### 🔹 **4. Activate the Virtual Environment**  
Navigate to the Local Hub directory and activate the virtual environment:  
```sh
cd local-hub\venv\Scripts\
activate
```
After activation, your terminal should look like this:  
```sh
(.venv) PS D:\91987\local-hub\venv\Scripts>
```  

#### 🔹 **5. Start the Local Server**  
Move to the backend directory and start the Flask web server:  
```sh
cd local-hub\venv\Backend
python app.py
```
The **server will start on**:  
```sh
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```  

#### 🔹 **6. Connect to Ngrok (Make It Globally Accessible)**  
Now, expose your local server using Ngrok:  
```sh
ngrok http 5000
```
Ngrok will generate a **public URL**, which you can share with others to access your repository securely.  

---

## **🔒 Secure Team Collaboration (Optional but Recommended)**  
For extra security, you can enable **basic authentication** in Ngrok, requiring users to enter a **username and password** before accessing the repository.  

Use the following command:  
```sh
ngrok http 5000 --basic-auth="user1:password1" --basic-auth="user2:password2"
```
This way, only authorized team members can access the repository.  

---

## **Troubleshooting & Fixes**  

💡 **Issue: Flask Module Not Found?**  
If Flask isn’t working within the virtual environment, reinstall it:  
```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade flask
```  

💡 **Issue: Ngrok Not Working?**  
Try reinstalling it in a specific location and ensure it’s properly configured.  

💡 **Other Issues?**  
If you've followed all steps and still face issues, try restarting the virtual environment:  
```sh
deactivate
activate
```
or seek support from the **Local Hub community**.
