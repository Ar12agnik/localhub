# localhub
Local Hub is an open-source concept designed to give developers full control over their code and repositories and collaboration. Built with privacy and decentralization in mind, it allows users to securely store, view, and share repositories without relying on any centralized services. 

**Purpose**
The vision behind Local Hub is simple yet powerful: to give developers full control over their code, credentials, and repositories—without the need for expensive storage subscriptions, "pro" features, or third-party restrictions.

At its core, Local Hub prioritizes decentralization and security, making it an ideal solution for private repositories. Instead of relying on centralized cloud services, your code stays in your own system, ensuring complete ownership and privacy.

Local Hub runs via an Ngrok-exposed local server, allowing you to securely share repositories with your team through a one-time authentication process. This approach ensures that access is temporary and entirely in your hands—if you detect any suspicious activity, you can instantly shut down access, protecting your data.

But Local Hub is more than just a hosting tool; it’s a customizable framework. It provides essential repository management features while allowing developers to extend and adapt it to their unique needs.

By keeping security, flexibility, and decentralization at its heart, Local Hub empowers developers to take back control of their code—without compromises. If you believe in open-source innovation and data sovereignty, join us in making Local Hub the future of secure, self-hosted development.

**Tech Description**
*Who Can Use Local Hub?
Local Hub is designed primarily for developers and tech-savvy users who want full control over their code and repositories. However, even users with basic computer knowledge and an understanding of how the internet works can follow simple steps to set it up and use it effectively.

*How It Works?
Local Hub follows a lightweight yet powerful architecture that runs within a virtual environment on your local system. This architecture is divided into two key components:

🔹 Backend – The backend is responsible for securely managing repositories, static files, and app views. It also includes an intelligent caching mechanism to optimize performance.

🔹 Frontend – The frontend consists of dynamic templates that render and display folders and files from the backend. It utilizes dynamic routing to provide seamless navigation and access to repositories without exposing unnecessary details.

The backend and frontend work together efficiently, ensuring a smooth, secure, and real-time experience for accessing and sharing repositories.

By keeping things modular and extendable, Local Hub allows developers to customize and expand its functionality based on their specific needs. Whether you're using it for personal projects or collaborating with a team, this framework provides full ownership, security, and flexibility—all without relying on third-party platforms.

Here’s a **refined, technically sound, and engaging** version of your **"How to Use"** section:  

---

## **How to Use Local Hub?**  

### **Requirements**  
Before getting started, ensure your system meets the following **requirements**:  

1️⃣ **Python**: Version **3.12.4** (or any latest version). You can check your version using:  
   ```sh
   python --version
   ```  

2️⃣ **Ngrok**: Download and install Ngrok from [here](https://ngrok.com/downloads/windows). *(Local Hub also includes a preconfigured Ngrok binary in the repository—try running it first before downloading.)*  

3️⃣ **Flask (Python Web Module)**: Install Flask using:  
   ```sh
   python -m pip install flask
   ```  

4️⃣ **Free Storage Space**: Ensure you have sufficient disk space based on your repository size. It’s recommended to **avoid using the C:\ drive** to prevent storage overflow and data loss.  

---

### **Step-by-Step Setup Guide**  

#### 🔹 **1. Choose a Storage Location**  
Select an **empty storage location** (e.g., `D:\LocalHub\`) for better security and performance.  

#### 🔹 **2. Clone the Repository**  
Download the Local Hub project by running:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/local-hub.git
```
*(Replace the link with the actual repository URL when available.)*  

#### 🔹 **3. Add Your Files**  
Place your **private repositories, files, and folders** in:  
```sh
local-hub\venv\Backend\Repositories\
```  

#### 🔹 **4. Activate the Virtual Environment**  
Navigate to the Local Hub directory and activate the virtual environment:  
```sh
cd local-hub\venv\Scripts\
activate
```
After activation, your terminal should look like this:  
```sh
(.venv) PS D:\91987\local-hub\venv\Scripts>
```  

#### 🔹 **5. Start the Local Server**  
Move to the backend directory and start the Flask web server:  
```sh
cd local-hub\venv\Backend
python app.py
```
The **server will start on**:  
```sh
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```  

#### 🔹 **6. Connect to Ngrok (Make It Globally Accessible)**  
Now, expose your local server using Ngrok:  
```sh
ngrok http 5000
```
Ngrok will generate a **public URL**, which you can share with others to access your repository securely.  

---

## **🔒 Secure Team Collaboration (Optional but Recommended)**  
For extra security, you can enable **basic authentication** in Ngrok, requiring users to enter a **username and password** before accessing the repository.  

Use the following command:  
```sh
ngrok http 5000 --basic-auth="user1:password1" --basic-auth="user2:password2"
```
This way, only authorized team members can access the repository.  

---

## **Troubleshooting & Fixes**  

💡 **Issue: Flask Module Not Found?**  
If Flask isn’t working within the virtual environment, reinstall it:  
```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade flask
```  

💡 **Issue: Ngrok Not Working?**  
Try reinstalling it in a specific location and ensure it’s properly configured.  

💡 **Other Issues?**  
If you've followed all steps and still face issues, try restarting the virtual environment:  
```sh
deactivate
activate
```
or seek support from the **Local Hub community**.
