Local Hub is in its early stages with limited features, and we're working to enhance its reliability. Our top priority now is adding .git integration, allowing users to push their code from a local directory to the Local Hub directory using Git Bash no more dragging and dropping folders. This will make our framework more efficient. We invite contributors to help build this feature and improve Local Hub as we grow.
